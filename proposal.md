# Motivation and Objectives
- Software studies benefit when more high quality participants are recruited. However, participant recruitment is challenging. There are new tools (Mechanical Turk, Prolific)
- Anticipated goals and outcomes (e.g., open research problems to pursue, validation objectives, empirical studies).
-  Topics include: strategies for new platforms, specifically filtering; students vs practitioners; determining adequate sample sizes; ethical considerations of participant involvement (GDPR, use of emails); budgeting for recruitment costs.


# Format and Required Services
- The workshop is a working session dedicated to sharing strategies and challenges. Participants will prepare a 2 page position paper and expderience summary. Organizers will create themes around those position papers. We hope to solicit a keynote from a researcher working in a field with greater experience (such as psychology or sociology). The outcome of the workshop will be a SIGSOFT participant recruitment working paper. 
- Intended length (1 or 2 days).
- no special requirements

# Target Audience
- Industry and academic researchers doing participant recruitment for software studies (e.g., of developers, of 
- Plans regarding the mix of industry and research participation.
- Expected minimum and maximum number of workshop participants.
- Plans for soliciting and selecting workshop participants, including whether the workshop will be open or closed (in case of a closed workshop, provide a justification).

# Proceedings
- We intend to focus on short non-proceedings position papers to motivate open discussion at this point. No formal proceedings. 
- Our program committee will check the submissions for alignment with the workshop topics but formal review will not be conducted. 
- Online submission system to be used by the workshop (e.g., Easychair or HotCRP).
